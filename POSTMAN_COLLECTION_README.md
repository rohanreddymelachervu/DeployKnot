# DeployKnot API Postman Collection

This Postman collection provides a complete set of requests for testing and interacting with the DeployKnot API. The collection includes all available endpoints including health checks, deployment management, and Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time log streaming.

## üìã Collection Overview

### Health Check Endpoints
- **Health Check - Root**: `GET /health`
- **Health Check - API v1**: `GET /api/v1/health`

### Deployment Management Endpoints
- **List Deployments**: `GET /api/v1/deployments`
- **Create Deployment**: `POST /api/v1/deployments`
- **Get Deployment**: `GET /api/v1/deployments/{id}`
- **Get Deployment Logs (JSON)**: `GET /api/v1/deployments/{id}/logs`
- **Get Deployment Logs (SSE)**: `GET /api/v1/deployments/{id}/logs` (with SSE headers)
- **Get Deployment Steps**: `GET /api/v1/deployments/{id}/steps`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Import the Collection
1. Open Postman
2. Click "Import" button
3. Select the `DeployKnot_API_Collection.json` file
4. The collection will be imported with all endpoints

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
The collection uses the following variables that you should configure:

#### Collection Variables
- `base_url`: The base URL of your DeployKnot API server (default: `http://localhost:8080`)
- `deployment_id`: A deployment UUID to use in requests (set this after creating a deployment)

#### How to Set Variables
1. Click on the collection name in Postman
2. Go to the "Variables" tab
3. Update the `base_url` to match your server
4. Set `deployment_id` after creating your first deployment

## üîÑ Server-Sent Events (SSE)

The SSE endpoint provides real-time log streaming during deployment execution. This is particularly useful for monitoring deployment progress in real-time.

### SSE Request
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/deployments/67cfd2e8-0917-45b7-8747-482730c62ef1/logs
Accept: text/event-stream
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

### SSE Response Format
The SSE endpoint returns events in the following format:

```
event: connected
data: {"deployment_id":"67cfd2e8-0917-45b7-8747-482730c62ef1","timestamp":"2025-07-11T22:08:31.106+05:30"}

event: log
data: {"id":"log-uuid","deployment_id":"67cfd2e8-0917-45b7-8747-482730c62ef1","created_at":"2025-07-11T22:08:31.106+05:30","log_level":"info","message":"Processing deployment job","task_name":"deployment","step_order":1}

event: log
data: {"id":"log-uuid-2","deployment_id":"67cfd2e8-0917-45b7-8747-482730c62ef1","created_at":"2025-07-11T22:08:31.701+05:30","log_level":"info","message":"SSH connection established successfully","task_name":"ssh_connection","step_order":2}
```

### Testing SSE in Postman
1. Use the "Get Deployment Logs - SSE" request
2. Send the request
3. Postman will display the streaming events in the response body
4. The connection will remain open until the deployment completes or you close the request

- `cancelled`: Deployment was cancelled

## üß™ Testing Workflow

### 1. Health Check
Start by testing the health endpoint to ensure the server is running:
```
GET /health
```

### 2. Create Deployment
Create a new deployment using one of the provided examples:
```
POST /api/v1/deployments
```

### 3. Monitor Deployment
Use the deployment ID from the create response to monitor progress:

#### Get Deployment Status
```
GET /api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}
```

#### Stream Real-time Logs
```
GET /api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/logs (with SSE headers)
```

#### Get Deployment Steps
```
GET /api/v1/deployments/{deployment_id}/steps
```

### 4. List All Deployments
```
GET /api/v1/deployments
```

## üîí Security Notes

- **SSH Credentials**: Never commit real SSH passwords to version control
- **GitHub PAT**: Use GitHub Personal Access Tokens with minimal required permissions
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data in environment variables should be encrypted
- **Network Security**: Ensure your API server is properly secured in production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**: Ensure the DeployKnot server is running on the correct port
2. **Invalid UUID**: Make sure deployment IDs are valid UUIDs
3. **SSE Not Working**: Ensure you're using the correct headers (`Accept: text/event-stream`)
4. **Authentication Errors**: Verify SSH credentials and GitHub PAT are correct

### Error Responses

```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "message": "Field 'target_ip' is required"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "Deployment not found",
  "message": "The specified deployment does not exist"
}
```
